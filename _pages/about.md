## Personal Introduction 

I am a first year doctoral student majoring in Electronic science and technology at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Dr. Fanglin Bao](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/fanglin-bao.shtml). 🎓 I obtained my undergraduate degree in Automation from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). 🏫 

Now, I am dedicated to advancing my skills in AI and continuously working on computational imaging. I welcome collaboration opportunities and look forward to working with researchers and industry partners. 👥🤝

## Current Research Interests
My current research interests are centered around the intersection of AI and Physics, specifically focusing on **Optical Computing**, **Computational Imaging**, and **AI for Physics**. 

I am excited about the opportunity to continue my research at Westlake University and contribute to the advancement of these fields. I aim to conduct cutting-edge research that bridges the gap between theoretical developments and practical applications, ultimately leading to innovative and impactful solutions. 🚀🌟
