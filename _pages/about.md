## Personal Introduction 

I am Jiashuo CHEN, currently a doctoral student in the field of electronic science and technology at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Dr. Fanglin Bao](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/fanglin-bao.shtml). 🎓 I obtained my undergraduate degree in Automation from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). 🏫 During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern for two years at Pengkang Building, where I developed a strong passion for research, particularly in the areas of energy systems optimization. My current research focuses on the intersection of AI and Physics. 🤖💡 I am dedicated to advancing my skills in AI and continuously working on computational imaging. I welcome collaboration opportunities and look forward to working with researchers and industry partners. 👥🤝

## Current Research Interests
My current research interests are centered around the intersection of AI and Physics, specifically focusing on optical computing, AI, and computational imaging. Here are the key areas I am currently exploring:

1. **Optical Computing and Neuromorphic Photonics**:
   - Investigating the potential of optical neural networks (ONNs) to perform high-speed, low-power, and parallel computations. 🚀💡
   - Exploring the use of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to implement neuromorphic computing architectures that can mimic the functionality of biological neural networks. 🧠

2. **Computational Optical Imaging**:
   - Developing novel computational imaging techniques that leverage the unique properties of light to achieve high-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging. 📸🔬
   - Applying machine learning algorithms to enhance image reconstruction and processing, enabling real-time and adaptive imaging solutions. 🤖🔍

3. **AI for Physics**:
   - Investigating the cross-fertilization of AI and Physics to develop new methodologies and tools for scientific discovery. 🧪🤖
   - Applying deep learning and other AI techniques to analyze and interpret complex physical phenomena, such as those in materials science, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. 🌌💡

I am excited about the opportunity to continue my research at Westlake University and contribute to the advancement of these fields. I aim to conduct cutting-edge research that bridges the gap between theoretical developments and practical applications, ultimately leading to innovative and impactful solutions. 🚀🌟
