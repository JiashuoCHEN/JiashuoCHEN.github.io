## Personal Introduction

I am Jiashuo CHEN, currently a doctoral student in the field of electronic science and technology at Westlake University, under the supervision of [Dr. Fanglin Bao](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/fanglin-bao.shtml). My research focuses on the intersection of AI and Physics. I am dedicated to advancing my skills in AI and continuously working on computational imaging. I welcome collaboration opportunities and look forward to working with researchers and industry partners.

## Research Interests

### Early Research Interests

My early research interests were focused on the following areas:

1. **Energy Systems Optimization**:
   - Developed data-driven models to optimize the integration and management of building energy systems.
   - Formulated supply-demand matching frameworks and implemented Model Predictive Control (MPC) to enhance operational efficiency and reduce energy consumption.

2. **Machine Learning and Data Analytics**:
   - Applied advanced machine learning techniques to extract meaningful features from complex datasets.
   - Utilized regression and classification algorithms to predict and optimize energy system performance.

3. **Microgrid and Renewable Energy Integration**:
   - Modeled and optimized the operation of microgrids under uncertainty, considering storage, demand-side load, and coordinated control.
   - Analyzed the effectiveness of proposed models through simulation and experimental validation.

### Current Research Interests

My current research interests are centered around the intersection of AI and Physics, specifically focusing on optical computing, AI, and computational imaging. Here are the key areas I am currently exploring:

1. **Optical Computing and Neuromorphic Photonics**:
   - Investigating the potential of optical neural networks (ONNs) to perform high-speed, low-power, and parallel computations.
   - Exploring the use of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to implement neuromorphic computing architectures that can mimic the functionality of biological neural networks.
   - Studying the integration of ONNs with traditional electronic computing systems to create hybrid platforms for enhanced computational capabilities.

2. **Computational Optical Imaging**:
   - Developing novel computational imaging techniques that leverage the unique properties of light to achieve high-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging.
   - Exploring the use of coherent and incoherent light sources, polarization, and coherence to improve the performance of optical imaging systems.
   - Applying machine learning algorithms to enhance image reconstruction and processing, enabling real-time and adaptive imaging solutions.

3. **AI and Physical Sciences**:
   - Investigating the cross-fertilization of AI and physical sciences to develop new methodologies and tools for scientific discovery.
   - Applying deep learning and other AI techniques to analyze and interpret complex physical phenomena, such as those in materials science, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

I am excited about the opportunity to continue my research at Westlake University and contribute to the advancement of these fields. I aim to conduct cutting-edge research that bridges the gap between theoretical developments and practical applications, ultimately leading to innovative and impactful solutions.
